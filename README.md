# D&D 5e API

This project started because a friend and I were trying to build a character
creator in Rails for 5th Edition. With the amount of data required we decided to
try and split the project into three parts.  The API which you will see here, a
gem wrapper library for the API that can be included on any Ruby project, and
then the character creator itself.

This is still under development so excuse the mess of code.
